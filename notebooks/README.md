## Predict Air Quality

This project builds an Air Quality Forecasting Service for an Air Quality sensor available at https://waqi.info/.


The output is a forecast for air quality, like this one:

## Personalized Air Quality Predictions with a LLM

This air quality forecasting service has been augmented with LLM capabilities. You can ask it both future (forecasting) and historical questions about air quality at your location via a microphone or text input dialog.

The RAG in this application augments the prompt with:
 * your location,
 * todayâ€™s date,
 * predicted air quality (from a ML model),
 * historical air quality (from the feature store),
 * are you in a sensitive group (coming soon).
