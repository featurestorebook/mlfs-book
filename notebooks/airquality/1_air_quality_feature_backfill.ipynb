    "\n",
    "  * Try adding a new feature based on a rolling window of 3 days for 'pm25'\n",
    "      * This is not easy, as forecasting more than 1 day in the future, you won't have the previous 3 days of pm25 measurements.\n",
    "      * df.set_index(\"date\").rolling(3).mean() is only the start....\n",
    "  * Parameterize the notebook, so that you can provide the `country`/`street`/`city`/`url`/`csv_file` as parameters. \n",
    "      * Hint: this will also require making the secret name (`SENSOR_LOCATION_JSON`), e.g., add the street name as part of the secret name. Then you have to pass that secret name as a parameter when running the operational feature pipeline and batch inference pipelines.\n",
    "      * After you have done this, collect the street/city/url/csv files for all the sensors in your city or region and you make dashboards for all of the air quality sensors in your city/region. You could even then add a dashboard for your city/region, as done [here for Poland](https://github.com/erno98/ID2223).\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve this AI System\n",
    "  * As of mid 2024, there is no API call available to download historical data from the AQIN website. You could improve this system by writing a PR to download the CSV file using Python Selenium and the URL for the sensor.\n"
